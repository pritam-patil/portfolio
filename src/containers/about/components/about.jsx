        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I started my first job in Bangalore as an Embedded <span>C</span> developer building broadcast systems. Then moving to
            web domain as a <span>Backend</span> developer for <span>Ad-delivery network</span>. Leaving Bangalore, I joined a <span>IoT</span> startup as
            <span> Python</span> developer building backend for the product. After a while, I started out as <span>NodeJS </span>developer in Pune.
            With decent backend understanding, moved to Frontend as a <span>ReactJS</span> developer.
            I did a bit of <span>freelance</span> work between jobs in Electron, Flutter and React-Native.
            I'm crazy about engaging design/UX and feel excited about ML/AI. I like to read and try out Ethical hacking.
